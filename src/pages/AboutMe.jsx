        Hi! My name is Jaxon Grosam, and I'm about to finish a coding bootcamp.
        This project is to beef up my skill seven further before I get sent out
        into the field. I enjoy Javascript and React so much and I plan to pick
        up even more skills in the future. Best wishes from me and thank you for
        visiting my page!
      </p>

const containerStyle = {

  padding: "30px",

  float: "left",
  marginTop: "20px",
};
